✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve trips` to start the development server!

## Test the application

Run the tests for the entire Monorepo:

```
npx nx run-many -t test
```

Run the tests for the entire Monorepo with coverage:

```
npx nx run-many -t test --coverage
```

## Check for circular dependencies

Use Madge to check for circular dependencies:

```
madge --circular --ts-config ./tsconfig.base.json --extensions ts ./
```

**Note**: *Madge must be installed either locally or globally in order to run the previous command*.

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build trips` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
